This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks displaying my proficiency of data analysis and machine learning algorithms.

# DataHacks 2020 Finalist

In this competition, David, Nathan, and I found studies that proved that African Americans are more likely to experience mortality due to diabetes than other races. As a result, we wanted to use the data we were given to find if African Americans are receiving racial bias within the healthcare system. Click this link to view our work:

# Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets

In this Kaggle competition, I had to predict whether a tweet was really about a disaster or not based on the words in the tweet. I used matplotlib to plot the tweets to visualize the number of character in a tweet and number of words in a tweet to as my exploratory data analysis. Due to the fact that I am analyzing tweets, I must clean the tweet by removing emojis, hashtags, html tags, and links to help me easily implement my TFidfVectorizer to transform the raw text into feature vectors that will help me predict its classification using K-nearest neighbors (90). I used cross validation score of 4 fold to measure how accurate my results were and I received an average of 73%. Click this link to view my work: https://github.com/JosephBui21/TweetClassification

# Snapchat Advertisement Regression Problem

In this project, I worked with another classmate to download data from 2018 and 2019 from the Snapchat website to predict how much a company spends on an advertisement using regression. Click the link to view our work: https://github.com/JosephBui21/Snapchat-Ads-Prediction-Problem 

# Snapchat Advertisement

In this project, I worked with another classmate to use the data from Snapchat to determine whether or not ads are targeted agnostically (by column) or specifically will affect the impressions per dollar spent by the advertiser using hypothesis tests.

# Computing grades for fictional class

In this project, my partner and I portray our proficiency of pandas dataframe and numpy basics to clean and process data of a fictional class to compute total course grades according to a fictional syllabus. Click the link to view our work: https://github.com/JosephBui21/fictional-class-grades
