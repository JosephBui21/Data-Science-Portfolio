# Snapchat Advertisement Regression Problem

In this project, I worked with another classmate to download data from 2018 and 2019 from the Snapchat website to predict how much a company spends on an advertisement using regression. Click the link to see our work: https://github.com/JosephBui21/Snapchat-Ads-Prediction-Problem 

# Snapchat Advertisement

In this project, I worked with another classmate to use the data from Snapchat to determine whether or not ads are targeted agnostically (by column) or specifically will affect the impressions per dollar spent by the advertiser using hypothesis tests.

# Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets

In this Kaggle competition, I had to predict whether a tweet was really about a disaster or not based on the words in the tweet. I used matplotlib to plot the tweets to visualize the number of character in a tweet and number of words in a tweet to as my exploratory data analysis. Due to the fact that I am analyzing tweets, I must clean the tweet by removing emojis, hashtags, html tags, and links to help me easily implement my TFidfVectorizer to transform the raw text into feature vectors that will help me predict its classification using K-nearest neighbors (90). I used cross validation score of 4 fold to measure how accurate my results were and I received an average of 73%.
